Original prompt: Build a web service game that tracks my hand from camera and controls flying blades (drone-like) with TypeScript and Phaser3; start with specification/planning.

## 2026-02-13
- Read and applied develop-web-game skill guidance for planning stage.
- Created `docs/mvp-spec-v2.md` with updated scope:
  - Dozens of blades (30 to 80), scatter/gather/dash swarm modes.
  - Gesture-based effect triggers (Open Palm, Fist, Pinch).
  - Local-only hand tracking design in browser.
  - Performance/privacy/DoD/test hooks requirements.
- Created `docs/tasks.md` with phased implementation plan and exit criteria.
- Completed Phase 0 scaffold files for Vite + TypeScript + Phaser3:
  - `index.html`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig*`, `eslint.config.js`, `.prettierrc`
  - Phaser scenes: `BootScene`, `MenuScene`, `GameScene`, `GameOverScene`
  - Runtime hooks: `window.render_game_to_text`, `window.advanceTime`
  - Fullscreen toggle: `f` key, `Esc` exits browser fullscreen behavior
- Updated `package.json` scripts for dev/build/typecheck/lint/format.

## Test/Run Notes
- `pnpm install` failed in this environment due DNS/network restriction:
  - `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN registry.npmjs.org`
- Because dependencies could not be installed, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm lint` were not executed yet.

## TODO
- Run `pnpm install` in a network-enabled environment.
- Execute `pnpm dev`, verify scene transitions and fullscreen flow.
- Begin Phase 1 camera/tracking pipeline integration.
- Hardened lint configuration:
  - Split browser TS source rules (`src/**/*.ts`) from Node config files.
  - Added explicit browser globals to avoid false positives.
  - Disabled core `no-undef` for TypeScript files.
  - Updated lint script to `eslint . --max-warnings=0`.
- Updated `GameScene` visual baseline to match swarm fantasy:
  - Added space backdrop with star field.
  - Added 56 visible blade agents (triangles, additive glow).
  - Added swarm orbit/bob/pulse motion around moving anchor.
- Verified skills available locally: `develop-web-game`, `playwright`.
- Installed project/browser automation dependencies:
  - `pnpm install`
  - `pnpm add -D playwright`
  - `npx playwright install chromium`
- Lint/typecheck verification passed after setup:
  - `pnpm typecheck`
  - `pnpm lint`
- Attempted web-game Playwright run with `scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js` against local Vite server.
- Blocker: Chromium launch fails due missing system lib `libnspr4.so`.
- Attempted fix via `npx playwright install-deps chromium`, but environment requires sudo password and could not complete non-interactively.
- Implemented webcam hand tracking pipeline with MediaPipe Tasks Vision:
  - Added dependency `@mediapipe/tasks-vision`.
  - Added `src/tracking/handTracker.ts` (camera init, model load, per-frame inference, status handling).
- Integrated hand tracker into `GameScene`:
  - Blade swarm anchor now follows tracked hand (index fingertip) when available.
  - Added fallback autopilot motion when hand is not detected.
  - Added visual hand debug overlay with green dotted landmark connections + points.
  - HUD now shows `Hand <status>`.
  - Added tracker lifecycle cleanup on scene shutdown/destroy.
- Extended runtime text output with `trackingStatus`.
- Updated ESLint ignore to exclude `scripts/` helper copies.
- Validation passed: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`.
- User-reported issue handled: hand tracking showed `error` and camera preview visibility was undesired.
- Updated hand tracker:
  - Camera video element is now hidden off-screen (no visible camera preview).
  - Added robust hand landmarker initialization fallback:
    - Model URL fallback sequence
    - Delegate fallback sequence (GPU -> CPU)
  - Error aggregation improved for easier diagnosis.
- Updated HUD to show truncated hand-tracking error detail when status is `error`.
- Validation passed: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`.
- Addressed persistent `Hand error` by removing runtime CDN dependency for core assets.
- Added local static MediaPipe assets:
  - `public/mediapipe/wasm/*`
  - `public/mediapipe/models/hand_landmarker.task`
- Hand tracker now resolves WASM/model with local-first fallback chain.
- Updated ESLint ignore to include `public/` because vendored MediaPipe JS is not project source.
- Validation passed: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`.
- Implemented requested hand-driven swarm behaviors in `GameScene`:
  - Finger-open amount now controls swarm spread (`spreadFactor`).
  - Finger-close naturally regathers swarm.
  - Fast hand movement injects burst energy (`burstEnergy`) causing temporary blade detachment/scatter.
  - Burst energy decays over time so blades return to formation.
- Added hand openness estimator from landmarks (wrist-to-fingertip distances normalized by palm scale).
- Added hand speed sampling and thresholded acceleration response.
- HUD now exposes spread and burst metrics for tuning.
- Validation passed: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`.
- Updated control model to decouple swarm motion from hand lock-on behavior.
- Hand input now applies force toward an expanded target area (wider effective tracking range).
- When tracking is lost, swarm anchor no longer resets/recenters; it continues autonomous drift.
- Added inertial anchor velocity + drag + boundary bounce for asynchronous continuous motion.
- Spread no longer snaps back quickly on tracking loss; it relaxes slowly.
- Increased swarm visual dynamics significantly:
  - Expanded spread radius scale from narrow range to wide range.
  - Raised blade base radius range for larger on-screen formation.
- Added gesture-driven swarm behavior modes from landmarks:
  - `open` -> force-wide scatter
  - `fist` -> force-tight gather
  - `pinch` -> burst injection + spin boost (dash-like impulse)
  - `none` -> continuous ratio-based control
- Added gesture state + pinch cooldown logic and HUD visibility.
- Validation passed: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`.
- Improved first-recognition stability and responsiveness:
  - Added hand detector warm-up pass before entering live loop.
  - Slightly reduced inference frequency to lower frame hitch risk.
  - Added defensive detectForVideo error handling.
- Added intuitive motion-driven swarm controls:
  - Twirl gesture (finger orientation rotating) -> blades gather and co-rotate.
  - Throw gesture (fast left/right hand throw with open hand) -> swarm launches and scatters in that direction.
  - Kept shape gestures (open/fist/pinch) and layered dynamic gestures on top.
- Added soft control blend-in on tracking reacquire to reduce abrupt lock-on hitch.
- Validation passed: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`.
- Improved continuity under unstable hand detection:
  - Added tracking grace window (`trackingGraceSec`) so control does not drop immediately.
  - Added virtual hand target + velocity prediction to carry motion during brief tracking loss.
  - Cached last reliable landmarks and reused them during grace period for smoother gesture continuity.
- Made blades more fluid/independent:
  - Added per-blade position/velocity simulation.
  - Blades now spring toward orbit targets with per-blade noise, damping, and inertia (less rigid ring).
  - Rotation now follows local velocity vector for more natural motion.
- Validation passed: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`.
- User reported reduced responsiveness and dynamics after continuity changes.
- Re-tuned for responsiveness-first while keeping brief continuity:
  - Reduced tracking grace window from 0.5s -> 0.22s.
  - Faster control blend-in and stronger live tracking stiffness.
  - Reduced virtual-target lag (higher gain, higher blend).
  - Increased live tracking velocity retention.
  - Increased blade spring/noise and reduced over-damping for more dynamic motion.
- Increased hand inference cadence (28ms interval) to improve responsiveness.
- Validation passed: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`.
- Follow-up tuning based on user feedback (freeze on first recognition + too-attached swarm):
  - Hand tracker: switched delegate preference to CPU-first to reduce first-recognition hitch risk.
  - Hand tracker: slightly relaxed inference cadence to 30ms for smoother main-thread behavior.
  - Reduced direct hand-lock force on anchor (`stiffness` lowered).
  - Increased blade autonomy: lower spring, higher freedom/noise, lower damping loss.
  - Result target: less sticky-to-hand behavior while keeping responsive control.
- Validation passed: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`.
- Removed game-loop UI flow per user request:
  - No start screen and no game over flow (Boot now starts `GameScene` directly).
  - Removed score/time/game-over logic from `GameScene`.
  - HUD now focuses on control state only (hand/gesture/spread/burst).
  - `render_game_to_text` payload no longer includes score/hp.
